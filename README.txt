Our main project is located in the 'MainProject' repository on the 'master' branch. The primary source code file is named 'Main.java'.

To make any changes to the code:

1) Create your own branch
2) After you've made changes, commit your work (remember to comment thoroughly on each commit so that everyone can easily see the changes you've made)
3) Push your branch to the GitHub repository

Once every branch is tested it will be merged into the 'master' branch, and your changes will be part of the main project
